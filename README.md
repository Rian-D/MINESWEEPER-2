Personal Project - developed an AI-driven Minesweeper game in Python using knowledge engineering techniques

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented an AI agent that can solve Minesweeper using knowledge-based reasoning.
- Utilised constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and logical inference to mimic human decision-making.
- Developed an efficient algorithm to dynamically update game state based on uncovered tiles and applied learned knowledge.
- Created a user-friendly interface for visualising the AIâ€™s decision-making process.

Skills Acquired:
- Advanced problem-solving and algorithm design
- Knowledge representation and reasoning (AI/Knowledge Engineering)
- Python programming, including working with libraries like Pygame for GUI development
- Debugging and optimizing AI algorithms for performance
